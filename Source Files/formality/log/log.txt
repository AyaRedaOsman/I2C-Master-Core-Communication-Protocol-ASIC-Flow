Note: No guide_hier_map commands were found in the SVF. It is
      important to enable guide_hier_map generation in
      Design Compiler to avoid SVF rejections that can cause
      aborted/failing points or long run times during verification.
      In Design Compiler the recommended methodology uses variable
      hdlin_enable_hier_map and command set_verification_top.
